    <p>(That's right... ol' faithful, haha.) But seriously, I know you've been working hard this past year, and I hope in 2024 those efforts lead to more success and opportunities for you personally and professionally. Not everything might go as planned along the way, but its all about trusting the process and keep moving forward. That being said, if you ever need a break from it all, our door in Denver will always be open if you need to come chill and hit the slopes to reset. Erin can come too I guess... maybe. Merry Christmas dude!!!</p>
