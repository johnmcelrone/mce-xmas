    <h2>Apple Homepod Mini</h2>
    <p>Your first step towards smart home technology! Woo! This Homepod Mini shouldn't take up too much space, but from what I've researched it's one of the best "Smart Speakers" in it's bracket in terms of sound.

    <p>Before you say anything ... yes, I checked, these do have a "warm light" setting, so you won't be stuck with that dreaded, evil cold white! Aside from the Homepod itself, this will be your first set of smart devices for your apartment. I know you hate using the overhead light in your room, so the first and second bulbs can be put in the lamps on your dresser and nighstand, with an extra third bulb for any other light fixture you might get in the future! Now you'll be able to turn your lights on and off with Siri, as well as set profiles for mood lighting and other ambient fun!</p>

    <h2>Philips Hue Bridge</h2>
    <p>This $60 piece of shit is the most boring component out of the three, but it's necessary to allow all the devices to talk to one another. However, what is nice is that with the Bridge, you'll be able to add a ton of supported devices down the road if you so wish.</p>
