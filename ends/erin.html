    <h2>Fashion Nova Marsala Blazer</h2>
    <p>I've seen you wear something similar to this before, and I thought it could pair well with any outfit, plus it's semi-formal so it'll come in handy when you need to go into work or when you eventually nail that next internship! (If this isn't your style / color / whatever, let me know and we'll exchange for something else on Fashion Nova!)</p>
