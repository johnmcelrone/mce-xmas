    <h2>Echo Dot Smart Speaker</h2>
    <p>Yeah, I know, privacy, yadda-yadda-yadda. (Just don't hook it up to lock / unlock your doors, you'll be fine!) Smart speakers are all the rage right now, but I didn't really believe it until I tried it out some time ago at a friends house. With the Echo, you'll have this speaker as an entry-point into intergrating all sorts of devices into the home, most notably, lights. I know Mom uses Amazon Music a ton, so you'll be able to control it with your voice now on the fly! In a house full of idiots, hopefully this "smart" device can help a bit!</p>
