    <p>I know you play COD on Xbox, but I wasn't sure if you had any of these yet. (If you do already, let me know and I'll get them exchanged for something else!) I know, I know. It seems like complete bullshit, but I use these religiously when playing competitive ranked in Apex, Destiny, insert-FPS-game-here. The idea is they increase your range of motion with the joysticks, allowing for more nuanced control. I typically just use one for the right stick since it's really aiming that you benefit from with these, but most people use both. There will be a bit of a learning curve at first, but I swear by em'.</p>
