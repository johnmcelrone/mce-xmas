    <h2>Trigger Point GRID Foam Roller</h2>
    <p>I know you guys alread have a foam roller, but when looking into post-workout equipment apparently they all aren't created equally. The grooves on this one and sturdy core (apparently) help to really work out those sore and aching muscles and after a workout. Also includes some instructional videos that show techniques of how to use it!</p>
