    <h2>Otamatone (A Funky Electronic Japanese Instrument)</h2>
    <p>The Otamatone is a cute, quirky, and fun to play electronic musical toy characterized by its eighth note-shaped body, adorable moving mouth, and silly, buzzing, amusingly off-key "voice." Developed by design firm Maywa Denki, it was first released in Japan in 2009 and has been the country's best-selling musical toy ever since. The Otamatone creates electronic tones that you can control based on the position of your finger on the touch-sensitive fretboard. Use a switch on the back to choose an octave and slide your fingers up and down to play different notes. Open the Otamatone's mouth with a squeeze to change the sound from a hum to an “ahh” and create a “Wah Wah” effect.</p>
